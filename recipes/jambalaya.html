        <p>My family loves a lot of flavor and spice in our food and jambalaya delivers. This is my version of a New Orleans jambalaya that's got a nice kick to it but not overly hot for those whose tongues can't handle it.</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>2 tablespoons margarine or butter</li>
